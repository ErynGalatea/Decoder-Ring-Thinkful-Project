# Decoder-Ring-Thinkful-Project

Secret messages used to be all the rage back in the day! Kids would send them to each other so nobody could tell what they were saying, and even the military still uses them on a daily basis to ensure classified secrets don't get leaked. Message encryption is a huge part of modern society, and this app features 3 specific ciphers for you to try out.

The Caesar shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order. For example, if you were to "shift" the alphabet to the right by 3, the letter A would become D.

# The Polybius Square Cipher

The Polybius square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. For example, in the above table, the letter B would be represented by the numerical pair 21.

The substitution cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet. This cipher requires that the recipient have the substitution alphabet, otherwise it will be difficult for them to decode the message.
